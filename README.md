# Week_8_Eye_Project
MITxPro This project was a required component of the MITxPro Full Stack Developer Course

<h1>Description</h1>
This program utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create two eyes onscreen which then follow the User's mouse movements around the screen with its pupils. 

<h1>How to Run</h1>
To run this program download the files and place in a folder together. Then drag and drop the index.html file to a browser. The eyes should appear and begin tracking the movements of the User's mouse immediately. 

<h1>Roadmap of Future Improvements</h1>

1. In future I would like to create a button that randomizes the shapes and colors of the eyes. 
2. Create a feature that adds more eyes to the screen in a grid.
